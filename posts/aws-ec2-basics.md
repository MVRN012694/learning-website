## What is AWS EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
It allows you to run virtual servers called **instances**.

## Why EC2 is Important?

- No physical servers
- Pay only for what you use
- Scales easily
- Used in almost every AWS architecture

## Real-World Example

Think of EC2 like renting a computer in AWS’s data center instead of buying one.
