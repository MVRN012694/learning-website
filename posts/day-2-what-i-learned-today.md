## Today’s Learning

Today I learned how dynamic routing works in **Next.js App Router**.

### Key Points
- Dynamic routes use folders like `[slug]`
- In Next.js 16, `params` must be awaited
- Markdown makes content easy to manage

### Final Thought
Building daily learning habits makes knowledge stick 🚀
